What are GANs?

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs. They are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other in order to generate new instances of data. 


What are the application of GANs?

Rooted in game theory, GANs have wide-spread application: from improving cybersecurity by fighting against adversarial attacks and anonymizing data to preserve privacy to generating state-of-the-art images, colorizing black and white images, increasing image resolution, creating avatars, turning 2D images to 3D, and more.  


Why are GANs important?

As computing power has increased, so has the popularity of GANs and its capabilities. GANs have opened up many new directions: from generating high amounts of datasets for training machine learning models and allowing for powerful unsupervised learning models to producing sharper, discrete, and more accurate outputs. GANs have also informed research in adjacent areas like adversarial learning, adversarial examples and attacks, model robustness, etc.
